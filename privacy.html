  <h1>MieterSafe – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><small>Last updated: 2 December 2025</small></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how MieterSafe (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects your information
    when you use the MieterSafe mobile application (the “App”).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
  <p>
    MieterSafe is a mobile app that helps users scan, analyze, and manage documents (for example, waste or utility
    related documents) and store them securely. The App may also offer premium features through in-app purchases
    and subscriptions.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data we collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Account information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address (used for login, authentication, and communication)</li>
    <li>Basic profile metadata from our authentication provider (for example, creation date, last login)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 App usage and content</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Documents and images you upload or scan (for example, bills or waste-related documents)</li>
    <li>Data extracted from those documents (such as amounts, dates, categories)</li>
    <li>App usage information (for example, which features you use, how often you scan)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3 Device and technical data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
    <li>Crash reports and performance data</li>
    <li>Anonymous analytics and diagnostic data if enabled</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.4 Payment and subscription data</h3>
  <p>
    Payments and subscriptions are processed via Apple App Store and Google Play Billing.
    We do not store your full payment card details. We may receive:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-sensitive purchase information (product ID, subscription status, expiration dates)</li>
    <li>Information about credit packs, active subscriptions, and entitlements</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How we use your data</h2>
  <p>We use the collected data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate you and keep your account secure (for example, email-based sign-in)</li>
    <li>Provide the core App functionality (scanning, analyzing, and storing documents)</li>
    <li>Sync your data securely between your devices via our backend</li>
    <li>Determine and manage your access to premium features and credits</li>
    <li>Process and validate in-app purchases and subscriptions</li>
    <li>Improve the App, fix bugs, and monitor performance</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about important updates, changes, or issues</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Legal basis (for users in the EU/EEA)</h2>
  <p>For users in the European Union / European Economic Area, we rely on the following legal bases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – to provide the App and its features you have requested.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to maintain and improve the App, prevent abuse, and ensure security.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Legal obligations</strong> – to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such as tax or accounting rules.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consent</strong> – where required (for example, optional analytics, if used).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. How long we keep your data</h2>
  <p>
    We keep your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the App.
    If you request deletion of your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal data,
    except where we are required to keep certain data for legal or regulatory reasons.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data sharing and third parties</h2>
  <p>We may share or process data with the following types of service providers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Backend and database providers</strong> – to store your account and app data securely (for example, managed database and authentication services).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Payment and subscription providers</strong> – Apple App Store, Google Play, and subscription management services (for example,
      tools that help us validate purchases, manage subscriptions, and entitlements).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Analytics and crash reporting providers</strong> – to understand app usage and improve stability.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Infrastructure and security providers</strong> – hosting, logging, and security services.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. We only share data with third parties where it is necessary to provide the App,
    comply with the law, or protect our rights.
  </p>

  <h2>7. International data transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Our infrastructure or service providers may be located in other countries.
    Where data is transferred outside the EU/EEA, we take appropriate measures to ensure an adequate level of protection,
    such as using providers that implement standard contractual clauses or equivalent safeguards.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your rights (especially for EU/EEA users)</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the personal data we hold about you</li>
    <li>Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your data (“right to be forgotten”)</li>
    <li>Object to or restrict certain types of processing</li>
    <li>Request a copy of your data in a machine-readable format (data portability)</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise these rights, please contact us using the contact details below. We may need to verify your identity before responding.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16.
    If you believe that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
    However, no system can be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
    In case of significant changes, we may notify you in the App or by email.
